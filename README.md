# recruiter [WIP]
Embeddable forms for recruiting usability research participants. Uses Google Tag Manager to load form UI and targeting, and a custom Google Apps Script to send submissions to a Google Sheet.

## Components

![feedback platform components](https://gsa.github.io/recruiter/Feedback_Platform_Components.svg)


 - [Google Sheets Template](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheets/d/1_de-8lkbxPAy0ovb_WH22EI03vX8ZnuZhhiXnXWvxpQ/copy)
 - [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com) - account required
 - [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/a/gsa.gov/d/1CSUCE9JHkMOutafCJxw3NTQ-J3n3PZlF0Z9UEJae9KxIlcq_AkWTXsEa/edit?usp=sharing) (for reference only - already bound to Sheets Template)
 - [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) styles and [form patterns guidance](https://standards.usa.gov/components/form-templates/) for accessibility.

 **Optional**
 - _TODO: Google Analytics integration (capture response events + session metadata)_


## Deploying

### 1. Google Spreadsheet template
 1. Make a copy of the [Spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheets/d/1_de-8lkbxPAy0ovb_WH22EI03vX8ZnuZhhiXnXWvxpQ/copy) (contains gScript for processing submissions)
 2. From main Sheets menu, select **`Tools`** > **`Script editor`**

 3. From the Script editor main menu, select **`Publish`** > **`Deploy as web app`**

    a. enter **`Project Version name`** and click **`Save New Version`**

    b. set **`Execute the app as`** to **`User accessing the web app`**

    c. set **`Who has access to the app`** to **`Only myself`**

    d. Click **`Deploy`**

 4. Back in the Spreadsheet, select the **`Settings`** sheet tab, and copy the value of **`WebAppURL`**

 5. In Google Tag Manager, paste the value you copied into the **`WebAppURL`** Custom Variable
    _(TODO: can this be read from the sheet by GTM? Could a custom UI button push this to GTM, where the container ID is added to the `Settings` tab on the sheet?)_


### 2. Google Tag Manager
1. Download [gtm-recruiter-to-gsheet.json](https://github.com/laurenancona/recruiter/blob/master/gtm-recruiter-to-sheet.json)
2. If needed, [create a Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com) account. _(If GTM is already in use on the site and you have access to the container, skip to Step 4)_
3. Create a new Tag Manager Container and **`Publish`** the (currently empty) container.
4. In Main Menu under **`Admin`** > **`Container`**, select **`Import Container`** _(TODO: TEST import to a GTM container)._

    a. For **`Choose Container File`**, select the file you downloaded above.

    b. For **`Choose workspace`**:

      - For new containers, select **`New`**

      - For existing containers, select **`Existing`**

    c. For **`Choose an import option`** select **`Merge`**

5. Install (or have agency install) the Tag Manager snippet code in the site template.
6. Create any specialized **`Triggers`** in Tag Manager, e.g. "Only show recruiter on pages in /directory", etc. for the following **`Tag`**:

    - **`recruiter.js`** Controls where the recruiter "tab" appears within the site. By default, it is set to appear on all pages that have the GTM snippet installed.

7. **Test** GTM config correctly loads recruiter locally (see [Preview and Debug containers](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107056?visit_id=1-636286168306770023-1579186406&rd=1))
8. **Publish** GTM container. 
  
  **Reminder: this is equivalent to pushing code to production and should follow any QA + testing standards.**

## Default fields provided in this configuration:

 | Field name | Type | Description |
 | ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
 | Date | Timestamp | submission time and date |
 | Name | String | First name |
 | Email | String | Email address |
 | UserAgent | String | OS + Version, Browser + version |
 | URL* | String | URI of page where form was submitted |
 | Referrer* | String | Referring page (how user arrived at PageURL |

**\*Note:** When deploying to sites where URLs contain references to content that may infer information of a personal or sensitive nature (e.g. visiting content related to medical conditions on NIH.gov), you may wish to omit passing the last two fields (`URL` and `Referrer`) to the Sheet. This can be done simply by removing the last two query parameters (`&Referrer={{Referrer}}&URL={{Page URL}}`) from the URL in the `Recruiter to Google Sheet` Custom Image Tag in GTM.

 **Warning: PIA, [PRA](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/guidance/pra-overview.html) or other privacy or security compliance issues may be triggered for any customized capture fields. Consult Chief Privacy Officer and/or PRA Desk Officer before deploying any customized form versions.**
